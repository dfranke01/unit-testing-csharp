code from the NUnit tutorial found at http://2manyprojects.net

uses visual studio express 2010 and Nunit test runner.

there are 3 projects within anagram.sln.
    1) anagramMain - think of this as your "application", i.e. no 
                     testing code will be included or referenced.

    2) anagramTest - this project contains your test cases, and 
                     test data. Has refs to anagramLib, and
                     gtest.

    3) anagramLib - this project contains the functions that are
                    tested using gtest, and called from your 
                    main() application.


Instructions
   
    1) checkout code from repository
    2) install nunit on your local machine.

       and replace the reference to nunit if you have a version 
       different from what is in the repository ).
